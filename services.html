  <h2>BI and BA foundations</h2>
  <p>Having problems setting your company as "data-driven"? Let your team get the leastest releases and concepts in Business Intelligence (BI) and Business Analytics (BA). In this four-hour workshop we will work on concepts from open-source / commercial software, languages and platforms to applied data modelling. We will put hands on a real case on segmenting sellers from a company. Can't let your team work without these data concepts. </p>
  
  <h2>Web Scraping</h2>
  <p>Let's suppose you want to download all the products available in one (or multiple) e-commerce website(s). You start by hand getting the first 10 but suddenly you figure out there are millions of articles. What you do? You <a href = "/aboutme/#contact">contact us</a>. We automate data downloading by creating tailor-made bots so that you get your data while sleeping! This is called Web Scraping.</p>

  <h2>Data Visualizations</h2>
  <p>We prioritise skills over tools. There are a lot of people out there building tools but they tend to be about either preprocessing data or prediction and pattern detection for a handful of well defined cases. We love the tools but they don’t address the most difficult problem of how you turn the data into information that can be used in decision making. For that you need skilled analysts wielding tools. Creating the skills is a much harder problem. We have a range of workshops and training programmes that can kickstart your data science team. We can also build bespoke programmes to meet your needs and run problem solving hackathons.</p>
  <h2>Data Scientist</h2> 
  <h3>Customer</h3>
    <p>Use data to predict the behaviour of your customers, including acquisition, churn and lifetime value. Applying the latest in machine learning need not require a major investment. The value can be proven in days using open source software.</p>
  <h3>Sales</h3>
    <p>We understand sales drive your business. So why make So why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why makeSo why.</p>
