  <h1>Services</h1>
  <br>
  <p>We have divided our services into these categories</p>
  <li>1) Data-Driven Organization</li>
  <li>2) Data Analysis</li>
  <li>3) Data Visualization</li>
  <li>4) Web Scraping</li>
  <li>5) BI & BA foundations</li>
  <h2>BI and BA foundations</h2>
  <p>Having problems setting your company as "data-driven"? Let your team get the leastest releases and concepts in Business Intelligence (BI) and Business Analytics (BA). In this four-hour workshop we will work on concepts from open-source / commercial software, languages and platforms to applied data modelling. We will put hands on a real case on segmenting sellers from a company. Can't let your team work without these data concepts. </p>
  
  <h2>Web Scraping</h2>
  <p>Let's suppose you want to download all the products available in one (or multiple) e-commerce website(s). You start by hand getting the first 10 but suddenly you figure out there are millions of articles. What you do? You <a href = "/aboutme/#contact">contact us</a>. We automate data downloading by creating tailor-made bots so that you get your data while sleeping! This is called Web Scraping.</p>

  <h3>Got technical?</h3>
  <p>Giving value to your data requires knowlegde on technical skills. We start by feature engineering the data. We then use multiple regression, exponential smoothing and ARIMA models, then go further with regression trees, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks for <strong>predictive analytics</strong>; discriminant analysis, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, classification trees, naive Bayes and neural nets for classification, and association rules for affinity ("<a href = "img/services/perceptual.png" target="_blank">market basket</a>") analysis. Use principal components, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering to simplify and cluster your data. In <strong>prescriptive analytics</strong>, let us use decision trees, Monte Carlo simulation, and powerful conventional and stochastic optimization.</p>
  
  <p>Truth be told that <i>framing your business problem</i>'s always going to be more important than knowing all available skills in the literature.</p>
  
  <h2>Data Visualizations</h2>
  <p>Is you database an unused asset? Get the most out of your data with our data visualization expertise. Take real-time decisions watching your own tailored made dashboards: all your data sources in one place. We priotize your business needs over tools.</p>

  <h1>Technical part</h1>
  <p>We prioritise skills over tools. There are a lot of people out there building tools but they tend to be about either preprocessing data or prediction and pattern detection for a handful of well defined cases. We love the tools but they don’t address the most difficult problem of how you turn the data into information that can be used in decision making. For that you need skilled analysts wielding tools. Creating the skills is a much harder problem. We have a range of workshops and training programmes that can kickstart your data science team. We can also build bespoke programmes to meet your needs and run problem solving hackathons.</p>
